Task 1: BMI Calculator

This is a simple GUI-based BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator app built with Python and Tkinter. The app allows users to input their weight and height using sliders, and then calculates and displays their BMI category. The app categorizes BMI into four categories: underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese. The code is well-structured and easy to follow, making it a great starting point for anyone looking to build a similar app.


Task2: Simple Password Generator

This is a password generator application built with Python and Tkinter. The app allows users to generate strong and unique passwords based on their input preferences, including password length and character types. The generated password is then displayed in a new window along with its strength level. The app aims to provide a simple and convenient way for users to create secure passwords.


Task3:Voice Assistant

This is a voice assistant application built with Python, using the SpeechRecognition and pyttsx3 libraries. The app allows users to interact with it using voice commands, and it can perform various tasks such as telling jokes, recommending movies, opening websites, and more. The app uses natural language processing to understand user input and respond accordingly.
